      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",

      "*   **Classification:** Categorizing data into predefined classes (e.g., predicting whether a customer will churn or not).\n",
      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",

      "Philosophy, at its core, is the **love of wisdom**. It's a discipline that uses reason and critical thinking to explore fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Instead of relying on faith or dogma, philosophy seeks to understand these deep issues through careful argumentation and logical analysis. It's about asking \"why?\" and \"how do we know?\" about the most basic aspects of our reality and our place within it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main goals of philosophy are multifaceted. Firstly, it aims to **clarify concepts** and ideas that we often take for granted, such as truth, justice, beauty, and consciousness. Secondly, it seeks to **understand the nature of reality** itself, questioning what truly exists and how we can know it. Thirdly, philosophy strives to **guide our actions and judgments** by exploring ethical principles and the foundations of morality. Ultimately, it's about developing a more coherent and well-reasoned understanding of ourselves and the world around us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philosophy is a vast field, often divided into several major branches, each focusing on different fundamental questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Metaphysics:** This branch explores the fundamental nature of reality. It asks questions like: What is existence? What is the relationship between mind and body? Does God exist? What is time and space?\n",
      "*   **Epistemology:** This area deals with the nature and scope of knowledge. It investigates questions such as: What is knowledge? How do we acquire knowledge? What are the limits of our understanding? Can we be certain about anything?\n",

       "Philosophy, at its core, is the **love of wisdom**. It's a discipline that uses reason and critical thinking to explore fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Instead of relying on faith or dogma, philosophy seeks to understand these deep issues through careful argumentation and logical analysis. It's about asking \"why?\" and \"how do we know?\" about the most basic aspects of our reality and our place within it.\n",

       "The main goals of philosophy are multifaceted. Firstly, it aims to **clarify concepts** and ideas that we often take for granted, such as truth, justice, beauty, and consciousness. Secondly, it seeks to **understand the nature of reality** itself, questioning what truly exists and how we can know it. Thirdly, philosophy strives to **guide our actions and judgments** by exploring ethical principles and the foundations of morality. Ultimately, it's about developing a more coherent and well-reasoned understanding of ourselves and the world around us.\n",

    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",

    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

    "我比較0-shot、1-shot、5-shot三種結果後可發現模型的表現並不是單調上升，而是「部分改善、部分無變化、部分惡化」的混合情況。以下是我的分析：\n",
    "* Improved cases都是在提供1-shot或5-shot後進步，尤其是fear和anger改善較為明顯。這表示範例中的語氣、句型或情緒表達方式，有助於模型辨識特定情緒。\n",
    "* No improve cases的原句好像大多為語意含糊、語氣不明顯，或帶有諷刺、混合情緒，這可能使模型較難辨識。我認為這狀況代表模型對某些類型的語句本來就偏好某些標籤，而目前examples不足以改變模型的既有偏好。\n",
    "* Worse cases最常見的情況是模型變得過度偏向joy或sadness，這可能是因為提供過多相似格式的few-shot示例讓模型產生偏誤，就是過度模仿而沒有回到資料本身的語意。這可以得知越多的shot不見得是好的。\n",
    "\n",
    "綜言之，我認為Few-shot prompting不是越多就越好，而是要看範例是否與資料分布相符。模型雖然能從examples中學到提示，但語意分類仍受到句子本身難度、情緒模糊性以及範例偏向影響。整體來看few-shot prompting是能提升模型表現，但不完全對所有案例都有效。"

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
